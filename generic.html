							</b><br> 
							</br>Problem Statement  : Need to create Movie recommender system for the users, We have IMBD data in 2 files having 5000 movies with the movie names
						     </br>Project Description : Using IMBD data set we are creating a Recommender System for the user, We have 5000 Movies with 20 features(budget,id,geners,keywords,original_language,original_title,overview,popularity,production_companies, production_countries,release_date, revnue, run time,etc)
							</br> Approch : Need to create Content based movie recommender system using Cosine Similarity
						     </br>Solution: Used Feature Engineering techniques to find the imporant fields in the data.And I have created 3 important fileds Movie Id, Title and Tags[including: Actor, Director, and genres]. 
							 </br> After that I have converted the text into vectors Using NLP techniques like stopwords, stemming and countvectorizer.
							</br><b> Final Outpt : Used the cosine Similarity function to find the best similar movies for the users.</br>

							</br> Problem Statement: Data set has taken from kaggle and we have 2 variables called spam and ham, and in that target variable is spam
							</br>Approch : Need to create best fit Machine Learning algorithm  
							 </br>solution:First we have used the label encoder to convert the target variable into vector that is 0 and 1. We used some feature engineering techniques to understand the data and we have used tokenize techniques to convert text into vectors and used lambda function, then we have created 3 new features called number of characters, number of words and number of sentences, after that we used text preprocessing techniques like lowercase, tokenization, removing special characters, removing stop words and punctuation, and finally we have used stemming after that we have added all the features in one columns called transformed text, then we have used machine learning algorithm. </br>
							<b>Final Output: we have used many algorithm like Naïve Bayes { Gaussian, Bernoulli, multinomial naïve Bayes}, Linear regression , SVC, DT, KNN, Adaboost, Best performing model was Bernoulli naïve bayes giving the best accuracy and precision </a></b><br>

							</br>Problem Statement: A large e-commerce company with its operations in several countries. As the online giant grows, so has the number of fraudster merchants also grows.</br>
							project Description : Built a classification model to predict if the Merchant is a Fraudster or not for a Mid-term Hackathon conducted by INSOFE.</br>
							- The Hackathon was conducted for two days - first day was for Hackathon followed by technical discussion with presentation on second day.</br>
							- Used different supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost to classify a merchant as a fraudster or not.</br>
							- Random forest outperformed other models with 0.7 as F1 score.</br>
							Solution Implementation: Expected to create an analytical and modelling framework to predict the Merchant Fraudulency(yes/no) based on the quantitative and qualitative features provided in the dataset, Train classification Models used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, SVM, XGBoost.</a></b><br>

							<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Book Recommender System</b><br> 
							</br>Problem Statement: Creating a Book Recommender system for online readers</br>
							Project Description : We have 3 data set files, Book_title, Users and Ratings in this 3 files we have ISBN number in all the 3 files we have to import files in python using Latin keyword because files are separated by semicolons, not by a comma.</br>
						    Approach:Need to create collaborative based filtering recommender system for the users.</br>
                             Solution:After cleaning the data we have done feature engineering techniques then also we are not able to create a perfect recommender system so that we have created a 2 condition, a.which ever user has read more than 200 books we are only considering that users, b. we have used only those books which has got average rating of 50. After that we have got 810 user how has read more than 200 books and 742 books has been rated more than of average of 50 ratings.</br>
							Final Output: Created a pivot table in columns- userid, index- title, values- ratings, after that we have used cosine similarity to find the best similar books for the users.</a></b><br>

							</br><b> Problem Statement: India is seeing an explosion of new competitors in the Broadband space. 'India
									Broadband' is a company that is now seeing a lot of customer churn due to customer
									dissatisfaction because of broadband outages.</b><br>
							</br><b> The company has now curated a dataset, where it tracks several variables that it
									believes impact the outage duration. They have tracked three different outage
									durations, 0 for no outage, 1 for short outages that last anywhere between a few
									minutes and a maximum of 2 hours, and 2 for long outages that can last from 2 hours
									to sometimes even a couple of days.</b><br>

									  <p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Stock Tweets Prediction</b></br>
									  </br><b>A hedge fund uses 6 financial factors to predict the alpha signal in a stock. This alpha signal is used to make purchase decisions about the stock. The hedge fund now collected and tagged microblogging data for sentiment from the Social Media platform called ‘StockTwits’.StockTwits is used by people who regularly trade stocks. People on this platform tweet about stocks using the special character ‘$’ to indicate the name of the stock. These microblogs similar to tweets might contain important information about the alpha signal in a stock.Your goal is to build a sentiment analysis model using the tagged data. This sentiment analysis model should then be used to generate a new stock factor which together with the other stock factors should be used to predict the Alpha Signal.The hedge fund has anonymised the data, which contains 7 stock factors and an alpha signal. This alpha signal is generated using a near perfect algorithmic trading strategy. Unfortunately the number of stock factors, collected to run that strategy,are extremely high and have to be collected from a large number of data vendors at a high price.
