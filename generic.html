							<h2>Predict if the Merchant is Fraudster or not for an e-commerce client</h2>
								<p>Problem Statement: A large e-commerce company with its operations in several countries. As the online giant grows, so has the number of fraudster merchants also grows.</p>
									<p>Solution Implementation: Expected to create an analytical and modelling framework to predict the Merchant Fraudulency(yes/no) based on the quantitative and qualitative features provided in the dataset, Train classification Models used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, SVM, XGBoost.

							<h2>CoViD-19 CoronaVirus Visualization</h2>
							<p> Problem Statement: The 2019-nCoV is a contagious coronavirus that hailed from Wuhan, China. This new strain of virus has striked fear in many countries as cities are quarantined and hospitals are overcrowded. This dataset will help us understand how 2019-nCoV is spread aroud the world.
								Data we have 78 Columns and 259 Rows.</p>
						
								
							
								</p>Model SVM to predict the future prediction.</p>

								<h2>Broadband outage detection</h2>
								<p> Problem Statement: India is seeing an explosion of new competitors in the Broadband space. 'India
									Broadband' is a company that is now seeing a lot of customer churn due to customer
									dissatisfaction because of broadband outages.
									 The company has now curated a dataset, where it tracks several variables that it
									believes impact the outage duration. They have tracked three different outage
									durations, 0 for no outage, 1 for short outages that last anywhere between a few
									minutes and a maximum of 2 hours, and 2 for long outages that can last from 2 hours
									to sometimes even a couple of days.</p>

									<h2>House-Price Prediction</h2>

									<p>Problem Statement: To build a custom machine learning model for one of the leading real estate industries in the world. The custom model includes the multiple classes to be classiﬁed with diﬀerent condition.</p>
									<p>Solution Implementation: Developed a Stacked regression to predict the house price. Perform diﬀerent mathematical and diﬀerent techniques to solve the problem. Create a Stacked model to see the performance of the model.</p>

									<h2>Stock Tweets Prediction</h2>
									<p>A hedge fund uses 6 financial factors to predict the alpha signal in a stock. This alpha signal is used to make purchase decisions about the stock. The hedge fund now collected and tagged microblogging data for sentiment from the Social Media platform called ‘StockTwits’.StockTwits is used by people who regularly trade stocks. People on this platform tweet about stocks using the special character ‘$’ to indicate the name of the stock. These microblogs similar to tweets might contain important information about the alpha signal in a stock.Your goal is to build a sentiment analysis model using the tagged data. This sentiment analysis model should then be used to generate a new stock factor which together with the other stock factors should be used to predict the Alpha Signal.The hedge fund has anonymised the data, which contains 7 stock factors and an alpha signal. This alpha signal is generated using a near perfect algorithmic trading strategy. Unfortunately the number of stock factors, collected to run that strategy,are extremely high and have to be collected from a large number of data vendors at a high price.
