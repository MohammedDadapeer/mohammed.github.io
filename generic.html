							</b><br> 
							</br>Problem Statement: Predict Severity of airplane accident using ‘Accident ID’. Required to build Machine Learning models to anticipate and classify the severity of any airplane accident based on past incidents.
							</br>Data-set : Data set Contains 12 columns with 10000 rows for Train data and 11 columns with 2500 rows for test data set. 
							 </br>Output: Tag and label the severity data. Preprocess and clean the data for modeling. Train a classification model using Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Bagging Classifier, Voting Classifier.
							</br><b>1. severity Levels :Minor_Damage_And_Injuries | Significant_Damage_And_Fatalities | 	Significant_Damage_And_Serious_Injuries | Highly_Fatal_And_Damaging	</br>
							<b>2. Final Output: Accidient ID and severity</a></b><br>

							</br>Problem Statement: This dataset contains around 200k news headlines from the year 2012 to 2018 obtained from HuffPost. The model trained on this dataset could be used to identify tags for untracked news articles or to identify the type of language used in different news articles.
							</br>
							 Data-set : 200k news headlines from the year 2012 to 2018 obtained from HuffPost.
							 </br>
							 Solution: Categorization based Natural Language Processing, that would perform localization and recognition of text and categorize. Train a Classification Model using Text CNN, Bidirectional GRU + Convolution and LSTM.
							</br>Output: To identify tags for untracked news articles or to identify the type of language used in different news articles,Each news headline has a corresponding category. Categories and corresponding article counts.</a></b><br>

							</br>Problem Statement: A large e-commerce company with its operations in several countries. As the online giant grows, so has the number of fraudster merchants also grows.</br>
							project Describtion : Built a classification model to predict if the Merchant is a Fraudster or not for a Mid-term Hackathon conducted by INSOFE.</br>
							- The Hackathon was conducted for two days - first day was for Hackathon followed by technical discussion with presentation on second day.</br>
							- Used different supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost to classify a merchant as a fraudster or not.</br>
							- Random forest outperformed other models with 0.7 as F1 score.</br>
							Solution Implementation: Expected to create an analytical and modelling framework to predict the Merchant Fraudulency(yes/no) based on the quantitative and qualitative features provided in the dataset, Train classification Models used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, SVM, XGBoost.</a></b><br>

							</br><b> Problem Statement: India is seeing an explosion of new competitors in the Broadband space. 'India
									Broadband' is a company that is now seeing a lot of customer churn due to customer
									dissatisfaction because of broadband outages.</b><br>
							</br><b> The company has now curated a dataset, where it tracks several variables that it
									believes impact the outage duration. They have tracked three different outage
									durations, 0 for no outage, 1 for short outages that last anywhere between a few
									minutes and a maximum of 2 hours, and 2 for long outages that can last from 2 hours
									to sometimes even a couple of days.</b><br>

									  <p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Stock Tweets Prediction</b></br>
									  </br><b>A hedge fund uses 6 financial factors to predict the alpha signal in a stock. This alpha signal is used to make purchase decisions about the stock. The hedge fund now collected and tagged microblogging data for sentiment from the Social Media platform called ‘StockTwits’.StockTwits is used by people who regularly trade stocks. People on this platform tweet about stocks using the special character ‘$’ to indicate the name of the stock. These microblogs similar to tweets might contain important information about the alpha signal in a stock.Your goal is to build a sentiment analysis model using the tagged data. This sentiment analysis model should then be used to generate a new stock factor which together with the other stock factors should be used to predict the Alpha Signal.The hedge fund has anonymised the data, which contains 7 stock factors and an alpha signal. This alpha signal is generated using a near perfect algorithmic trading strategy. Unfortunately the number of stock factors, collected to run that strategy,are extremely high and have to be collected from a large number of data vendors at a high price.
